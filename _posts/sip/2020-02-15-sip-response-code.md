# 1xx 临时的(Provisional)

```
Provisional responses, also known as informational responses,
indicate that the server contacted is performing some further action
and does not yet have a definitive response. A server sends a 1xx
response if it expects to take more than 200 ms to obtain a final
response. Note that 1xx responses are not transmitted reliably.
They never cause the client to send an ACK. Provisional (1xx)
responses MAY contain message bodies, including session descriptions.
```

## 100 Trying

```
This response indicates that the request has been received by the
next-hop server and that some unspecified action is being taken on
behalf of this call (for example, a database is being consulted).
This response, like all other provisional responses, stops
retransmissions of an INVITE by a UAC. The 100 (Trying) response is
different from other provisional responses, in that it is never
forwarded upstream by a stateful proxy.
```

## 180 Ringing

```
The UA receiving the INVITE is trying to alert the user. This
response MAY be used to initiate local ringback.
```

## 181 Call Is Being Forwarded

```
A server MAY use this status code to indicate that the call is being
forwarded to a different set of destinations
```

## 182 Queued

```
The called party is temporarily unavailable, but the server has
decided to queue the call rather than reject it. When the callee
becomes available, it will return the appropriate final status
response. The reason phrase MAY give further details about the
status of the call, for example, "5 calls queued; expected waiting
time is 15 minutes". The server MAY issue several 182 (Queued)
responses to update the caller about the status of the queued call.
```

## 183 Session Progress

```
The 183 (Session Progress) response is used to convey information
about the progress of the call that is not otherwise classified. The
Reason-Phrase, header fields, or message body MAY be used to convey
more details about the call progress.
```



# 2xx 请求成功(successful)

```
The request was successful.
```

## 200 OK

```
The request has succeeded. The information returned with the
response depends on the method used in the request.
```

# 3xx 重定向(Redirection)

```
3xx responses give information about the user’s new location, or
about alternative services that might be able to satisfy the call.
```

## 300 Multiple Choices

```
The address in the request resolved to several choices, each with its
own specific location, and the user (or UA) can select a preferred
communication end point and redirect its request to that location.
The response MAY include a message body containing a list of resource
characteristics and location(s) from which the user or UA can choose
the one most appropriate, if allowed by the Accept request header
field. However, no MIME types have been defined for this message
body.
The choices SHOULD also be listed as Contact fields (Section 20.10).
Unlike HTTP, the SIP response MAY contain several Contact fields or a
list of addresses in a Contact field. UAs MAY use the Contact header
field value for automatic redirection or MAY ask the user to confirm
a choice. However, this specification does not define any standard
for such automatic selection.
This status response is appropriate if the callee can be reached
at several different locations and the server cannot or prefers
not to proxy the request.
```

## 301 Moved Permanently

```
The user can no longer be found at the address in the Request-URI,
and the requesting client SHOULD retry at the new address given by
the Contact header field (Section 20.10). The requestor SHOULD
update any local directories, address books, and user location caches
with this new value and redirect future requests to the address(es)
listed.
```

## 302 Moved Temporarily

```
The requesting client SHOULD retry the request at the new address(es)
given by the Contact header field (Section 20.10). The Request-URI
of the new request uses the value of the Contact header field in the
response.
The duration of the validity of the Contact URI can be indicated
through an Expires (Section 20.19) header field or an expires
parameter in the Contact header field. Both proxies and UAs MAY
cache this URI for the duration of the expiration time. If there is
no explicit expiration time, the address is only valid once for
recursing, and MUST NOT be cached for future transactions.
If the URI cached from the Contact header field fails, the Request-
URI from the redirected request MAY be tried again a single time.
The temporary URI may have become out-of-date sooner than the
expiration time, and a new temporary URI may be available.
```

## 305 Use Proxy

```
The requested resource MUST be accessed through the proxy given by
the Contact field. The Contact field gives the URI of the proxy.
The recipient is expected to repeat this single request via the
proxy. 305 (Use Proxy) responses MUST only be generated by UASs.
```

## 380 Alternative Service

```
The call was not successful, but alternative services are possible.
The alternative services are described in the message body of the
response. Formats for such bodies are not defined here, and may be
the subject of future standardization.
```

# 4xx 请求失败(Request Failure)

```
4xx responses are definite failure responses from a particular
server. The client SHOULD NOT retry the same request without
modification (for example, adding appropriate authorization).
However, the same request to a different server might be successful.
```

## 400 Bad Request

```
The request could not be understood due to malformed syntax. The
Reason-Phrase SHOULD identify the syntax problem in more detail, for
example, "Missing Call-ID header field".
```

## 401 Unauthorized

```
The request requires user authentication. This response is issued by
UASs and registrars, while 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) is
used by proxy servers.
```

## 402 Payment Required

```
Reserved for future use.
```

## 403 Forbidden

```
The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.
Authorization will not help, and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated.
```

## 404 Not Found

```
The server has definitive information that the user does not exist at
the domain specified in the Request-URI. This status is also
returned if the domain in the Request-URI does not match any of the
domains handled by the recipient of the request.
```

## 405 Method Not Allowed

```
The method specified in the Request-Line is understood, but not
allowed for the address identified by the Request-URI.
The response MUST include an Allow header field containing a list of
valid methods for the indicated address.
```

## 406 Not Acceptable

```
The resource identified by the request is only capable of generating
response entities that have content characteristics not acceptable
according to the Accept header field sent in the request.
```

## 407 Proxy Authentication Required

```
This code is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but indicates that the
client MUST first authenticate itself with the proxy. SIP access
authentication is explained in Sections 26 and 22.3.
This status code can be used for applications where access to the
communication channel (for example, a telephony gateway) rather than
the callee requires authentication.
```

## 408 Request Timeout

```
The server could not produce a response within a suitable amount of
time, for example, if it could not determine the location of the user
in time. The client MAY repeat the request without modifications at
any later time.
```

## 410 Gone

```
The requested resource is no longer available at the server and no
forwarding address is known. This condition is expected to be
considered permanent. If the server does not know, or has no
facility to determine, whether or not the condition is permanent, the
status code 404 (Not Found) SHOULD be used instead.
```

## 413 Request Entity Too Large

```
The server is refusing to process a request because the request
entity-body is larger than the server is willing or able to process.
The server MAY close the connection to prevent the client from
continuing the request.
If the condition is temporary, the server SHOULD include a Retry-
After header field to indicate that it is temporary and after what
time the client MAY try again.
```

## 414 Request-URI Too Long

```
The server is refusing to service the request because the Request-URI
is longer than the server is willing to interpret.
```

## 415 Unsupported Media Type

```
The server is refusing to service the request because the message
body of the request is in a format not supported by the server for
the requested method. The server MUST return a list of acceptable
formats using the Accept, Accept-Encoding, or Accept-Language header
field, depending on the specific problem with the content. UAC
processing of this response is described in Section 8.1.3.5.
```

## 416 Unsupported URI Scheme

```
The server cannot process the request because the scheme of the URI
in the Request-URI is unknown to the server. Client processing of
this response is described in Section 8.1.3.5.
``` 

## 420 Bad Extension

```
The server did not understand the protocol extension specified in a
Proxy-Require (Section 20.29) or Require (Section 20.32) header
field. The server MUST include a list of the unsupported extensions
in an Unsupported header field in the response. UAC processing of
this response is described in Section 8.1.3.5.
```

## 421 Extension Required

```
The UAS needs a particular extension to process the request, but this
extension is not listed in a Supported header field in the request.
Responses with this status code MUST contain a Require header field
listing the required extensions.
A UAS SHOULD NOT use this response unless it truly cannot provide any
useful service to the client. Instead, if a desirable extension is
not listed in the Supported header field, servers SHOULD process the
request using baseline SIP capabilities and any extensions supported
by the client.
```

## 423 Interval Too Brief

```
The server is rejecting the request because the expiration time of
the resource refreshed by the request is too short. This response
can be used by a registrar to reject a registration whose Contact
header field expiration time was too small. The use of this response
and the related Min-Expires header field are described in Sections
10.2.8, 10.3, and 20.23.
```

## 480 Temporarily Unavailable

```
The callee’s end system was contacted successfully but the callee is
currently unavailable (for example, is not logged in, logged in but
in a state that precludes communication with the callee, or has
activated the "do not disturb" feature). The response MAY indicate a
better time to call in the Retry-After header field. The user could
also be available elsewhere (unbeknownst to this server). The reason
phrase SHOULD indicate a more precise cause as to why the callee is
unavailable. This value SHOULD be settable by the UA. Status 486
(Busy Here) MAY be used to more precisely indicate a particular
reason for the call failure.
This status is also returned by a redirect or proxy server that
recognizes the user identified by the Request-URI, but does not
currently have a valid forwarding location for that user.
```

## 481 Call/Transaction Does Not Exist

```
This status indicates that the UAS received a request that does not
match any existing dialog or transaction.
```

## 482 Loop Detected

```
The server has detected a loop (Section 16.3 Item 4).
```

## 483 Too Many Hops

```
The server received a request that contains a Max-Forwards (Section
20.22) header field with the value zero.
```

## 484 Address Incomplete

```
The server received a request with a Request-URI that was incomplete.
Additional information SHOULD be provided in the reason phrase.
This status code allows overlapped dialing. With overlapped
dialing, the client does not know the length of the dialing
string. It sends strings of increasing lengths, prompting the
user for more input, until it no longer receives a 484 (Address
Incomplete) status response.
```

## 485 Ambiguous

```
The Request-URI was ambiguous. The response MAY contain a listing of
possible unambiguous addresses in Contact header fields. Revealing
alternatives can infringe on privacy of the user or the organization.
It MUST be possible to configure a server to respond with status 404
(Not Found) or to suppress the listing of possible choices for
ambiguous Request-URIs.

Example response to a request with the Request-URI
sip:lee@example.com:
	SIP/2.0 485 Ambiguous
	Contact: Carol Lee <sip:carol.lee@example.com>
	Contact: Ping Lee <sip:p.lee@example.com>
	Contact: Lee M. Foote <sips:lee.foote@example.com>
Some email and voice mail systems provide this functionality. A
status code separate from 3xx is used since the semantics are
different: for 300, it is assumed that the same person or service
will be reached by the choices provided. While an automated
choice or sequential search makes sense for a 3xx response, user
intervention is required for a 485 (Ambiguous) response.
```

## 486 Busy Here

```
The callee’s end system was contacted successfully, but the callee is
currently not willing or able to take additional calls at this end
system. The response MAY indicate a better time to call in the
Retry-After header field. The user could also be available
elsewhere, such as through a voice mail service. Status 600 (Busy
Everywhere) SHOULD be used if the client knows that no other end
system will be able to accept this call.
```

## 487 Request Terminated

```
The request was terminated by a BYE or CANCEL request. This response
is never returned for a CANCEL request itself.
```

## 488 Not Acceptable Here

```
The response has the same meaning as 606 (Not Acceptable), but only
applies to the specific resource addressed by the Request-URI and the
request may succeed elsewhere.
A message body containing a description of media capabilities MAY be
present in the response, which is formatted according to the Accept
header field in the INVITE (or application/sdp if not present), the
same as a message body in a 200 (OK) response to an OPTIONS request.
```

## 491 Request Pending

```
The request was received by a UAS that had a pending request within
the same dialog. Section 14.2 describes how such "glare" situations
are resolved.
```

## 493 Undecipherable

```
The request was received by a UAS that contained an encrypted MIME
body for which the recipient does not possess or will not provide an
appropriate decryption key. This response MAY have a single body
containing an appropriate public key that should be used to encrypt
MIME bodies sent to this UA. Details of the usage of this response
code can be found in Section 23.2.
```

# 5xx 服务器错误(Server Failure)

```
5xx responses are failure responses given when a server itself has
erred.
```

## 500 Server Internal Error

```
The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from
fulfilling the request. The client MAY display the specific error
condition and MAY retry the request after several seconds.
If the condition is temporary, the server MAY indicate when the
client may retry the request using the Retry-After header field.
```

## 501 Not Implemented

```
The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the
request. This is the appropriate response when a UAS does not
recognize the request method and is not capable of supporting it for
any user. (Proxies forward all requests regardless of method.)
Note that a 405 (Method Not Allowed) is sent when the server
recognizes the request method, but that method is not allowed or
supported.
```

## 502 Bad Gateway

```
The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid
response from the downstream server it accessed in attempting to
fulfill the request.
```

## 503 Service Unavailable

```
The server is temporarily unable to process the request due to a
temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. The server MAY
indicate when the client should retry the request in a Retry-After
header field. If no Retry-After is given, the client MUST act as if
it had received a 500 (Server Internal Error) response.
A client (proxy or UAC) receiving a 503 (Service Unavailable) SHOULD
attempt to forward the request to an alternate server. It SHOULD NOT
forward any other requests to that server for the duration specified
in the Retry-After header field, if present.
Servers MAY refuse the connection or drop the request instead of
responding with 503 (Service Unavailable).
```

## 504 Server Time-out

```
The server did not receive a timely response from an external server
it accessed in attempting to process the request. 408 (Request
Timeout) should be used instead if there was no response within the
period specified in the Expires header field from the upstream
server.
```

## 505 Version Not Supported

```
The server does not support, or refuses to support, the SIP protocol
version that was used in the request. The server is indicating that
it is unable or unwilling to complete the request using the same
major version as the client, other than with this error message
```

## 513 Message Too Large

```
The server was unable to process the request since the message length
exceeded its capabilities.
```

# 6xx 全局错误(Global Failures)

```
6xx responses indicate that a server has definitive information about
a particular user, not just the particular instance indicated in the
Request-URI.
```

## 600 Busy Everywhere

```
The callee’s end system was contacted successfully but the callee is
busy and does not wish to take the call at this time. The response
MAY indicate a better time to call in the Retry-After header field.
If the callee does not wish to reveal the reason for declining the
call, the callee uses status code 603 (Decline) instead. This status
response is returned only if the client knows that no other end point
(such as a voice mail system) will answer the request. Otherwise,
486 (Busy Here) should be returned.
```

## 603 Decline

```
The callee’s machine was successfully contacted but the user
explicitly does not wish to or cannot participate. The response MAY
indicate a better time to call in the Retry-After header field. This
status response is returned only if the client knows that no other
end point will answer the request.
```

## 604 Does Not Exist Anywhere

```
The server has authoritative information that the user indicated in
the Request-URI does not exist anywhere.
```

## 606 Not Acceptable

```
The user’s agent was contacted successfully but some aspects of the
session description such as the requested media, bandwidth, or
addressing style were not acceptable.
A 606 (Not Acceptable) response means that the user wishes to
communicate, but cannot adequately support the session described.
The 606 (Not Acceptable) response MAY contain a list of reasons in a
Warning header field describing why the session described cannot be
supported. Warning reason codes are listed in Section 20.43.

A message body containing a description of media capabilities MAY be
present in the response, which is formatted according to the Accept
header field in the INVITE (or application/sdp if not present), the
same as a message body in a 200 (OK) response to an OPTIONS request.
It is hoped that negotiation will not frequently be needed, and when
a new user is being invited to join an already existing conference,
negotiation may not be possible. It is up to the invitation
initiator to decide whether or not to act on a 606 (Not Acceptable)
response.
This status response is returned only if the client knows that no
other end point will answer the request.
